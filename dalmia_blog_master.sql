The bonds will be issued in denominations of 1 gram of gold. The issue and redemption price has been linked to the market price of gold. To add to this, investors will also earn an interest @2.75% per annum on their investment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those looking to invest in gold may find Gold Bonds a better option for investing in gold than buying physical gold or investing in gold ETFs. The following factors make the Sovereign Gold Bond more attractive over other options to invest in gold:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. The bonds will be issued by RBI on behalf of Government of India.<br />\r\n2. Instead of buying gold in physical form, the investors can park their money in bonds whose price would be linked to gold prices.<br />\r\n3. Investors will also earn an interest @2.75% per annum on their investment amount.<br />\r\n4. These Bonds can be offered as collateral to take loan.<br />\r\n5. The investors will not have to pay any Fund Management charges as in the case of gold ETFs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While all investment options in gold generate returns equivalent to the change in gold prices, the above factors make the Sovereign Gold Fund an attractive investment option.</p>\r\n','Vishal Jaiswal','','','Active',82,'Jan 12, 2017','2017-01-12 13:55:00','2017-01-12 10:03:12'),(2,'1','Invest in a financial plan; not an investment product','1_1.jpg','<p>Many a times, an agent selling an investment product visits a customer and explains the good feature of the product. If the customer likes the product, he invests into it. This is not a good idea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rather than investing money in an investment product on an adhoc basis, an investor should focus on achieving his financial goal. He should set his goals first and then evaluate the product. If the said product will help him in achieving any of his financial goals, then only he should invest in it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s suppose you need money for your child&rsquo;s higher education and marriage after 12 and 18 years respectively. You come across a new insurance plan with good features having a maturity of 15 years. You like the plan and invest in it. After few months, you again come across another insurance plan with a maturity of 20 years. You like the plan and invest in it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now consider this. You require funds after 12 and 18 years respectively but you have invested in products with maturity of 15 and 20 years respectively. As a result, even though the product might have been good it will not help you in achieving your financial goal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, identify your financial goals and invest in only those products which will help you achieve your goals.</p>\r\n','Vishal Jaiswal','','','Active',27,'Jan 11, 2017','2017-01-11 13:48:00','2017-01-12 04:57:54'),(3,'1','Why invest through Systematic Investment Plan','sip.jpg','<p>Investors generally tend to speculate on the right time to invest. They try to invest their money at a time when they believe that the prices have fallen to the lowest level. But I have not known anyone who have predicted with certainty whether the market is going to move &ndash; upwards, downwards or sideways in the short-term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Greed and fear play an important role in investment decisions taken by investors. As a result, they tend to invest when the markets are moving up and calm down or sell when the markets are going down, which is exactly what they should not be doing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The normal correct principal would be to invest at regular intervals through <strong>Systematic Investment Plan (SIP)</strong>. This is where the benefit of <strong>Rupee Cost Averaging</strong> comes in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Rupee Cost Averaging, an investor invests a fixed amount at regular intervals irrespective of the market movements. As a result, you will be able to buy more units when the markets are low. And when the markets are high, you do not stop investments, you continue to invest in the market, but you will buy lesser units.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apart from above, <strong>the other benefits that a Systematic Investment Plan offers are</strong>:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. It allows an investor to <strong>invest regularly</strong> and in a <strong>disciplined manner</strong>;<br />\r\n2. It is very <strong>convenient</strong> for those who cannot afford to invest lumpsum amount; and<br />\r\n3. You <strong>do not need to know when to buy and at what price</strong>, as long as you are convinced about the indicative &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; long term returns on your investment.</p>\r\n','Vishal Jaiswal','','','Active',41,'Jan 10, 2017','2017-01-10 13:13:00','2017-01-12 04:58:08'),(4,'','He invites pain','','He invites pain.
